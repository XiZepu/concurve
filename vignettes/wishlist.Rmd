Here are some ideas/implementations I'm hoping to include within `concurve` at some point within the future. 

* Produce consonance functions for quantile regressions from the `quantreg` package
* Implement with the `nlme` package 
* Possibly incorporate `Stan` via `rstantools` to produce likelihoods and posteriors

If you'd like to help contribute, please see the [contributing guide](https://data.lesslikely.com/concurve/CONTRIBUTING.html).
