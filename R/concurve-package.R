#' Consonance, Surprisal, & Likelihood Functions
#'
#' Allows one to compute compatibility (confidence)
#' intervals for various statistical tests along with their corresponding
#' P-values, S-values, and likelihoods. The intervals can be plotted to
#' create consonance, surprisal, and likelihood functions allowing one to
#' see what effect sizes are compatible with the test model at various
#' compatibility levels rather than being limited to one interval estimate
#' such as 95\%.
