Description: Allows one to compute confidence (consonance) intervals for various statistical tests along with their corresponding P-values and S-values. The intervals can be plotted to create P- and S-value functions allowing one to see what effect sizes are compatible with the test model at various levels rather than being limited to one interval estimate.
