 @article{Cole_Chu_Greenland_2013, title={Maximum Likelihood, Profile Likelihood, and Penalized Likelihood: A Primer}, volume={179}, ISSN={0002-9262}, DOI={10/f5mx4q}, abstractNote={The method of maximum likelihood is widely used in epidemiology, yet many epidemiologists receive little or no education in the conceptual underpinnings of the approach. Here we provide a primer on maximum likelihood and some important extensions which have proven useful in epidemiologic research, and which reveal connections between maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. For a given data set and probability model, maximum likelihood finds values of the model parameters that give the observed data the highest probability. As with all inferential statistical methods, maximum likelihood is based on an assumed model and cannot account for bias sources that are not controlled by the model or the study design. Maximum likelihood is nonetheless popular, because it is computationally straightforward and intuitive and because maximum likelihood estimators have desirable large-sample properties in the (largely fictitious) case in which the model has been correctly specified. Here, we work through an example to illustrate the mechanics of maximum likelihood estimation and indicate how improvements can be made easily with commercial software. We then describe recent extensions and generalizations which are better suited to observational health research and which should arguably replace standard maximum likelihood as the default method.}, number={2}, journal={American Journal of Epidemiology}, author={Cole, Stephen R. and Chu, Haitao and Greenland, Sander}, year={2013}, month={Oct}, pages={252–260} }

 @article{Rafi_Greenland_2020, title={Semantic and Cognitive Tools to Aid Statistical Science: Replace Confidence and Significance by Compatibility and Surprise}, url={https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08579}, abstractNote={Researchers often misinterpret and misrepresent statistical outputs. This abuse has led to a large literature on modification or replacement of testing thresholds and P-values with confidence intervals, Bayes factors, and other devices. Because the core problems appear cognitive rather than statistical, we review some simple proposals to aid researchers in interpreting statistical outputs. These proposals emphasize logical and information concepts over probability, and thus may be more robust to common misinterpretations than are traditional descriptions. The latter treat statistics as referring to targeted hypotheses conditional on background assumptions. In contrast, we advise reinterpretation of P-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, in which they describe compatibility of data with the entire set of analysis assumptions. We use the Shannon transform of the P-value $p$, also known as the surprisal or S-value $s=-log(p)$, to provide a measure of the information supplied by the testing procedure against these assumptions, and to help calibrate intuitions against simple physical experiments like coin tossing. We also advise tabulating or graphing test statistics for alternative hypotheses, and interval estimates for different percentile levels, to thwart fallacies arising from arbitrary dichotomies. We believe these simple reforms are well worth the minor effort they require.}, journal={arXiv:1909.08579 [stat.ME]}, author={Rafi, Zad and Greenland, Sander}, year={2020} }
