Title: Computes and Plots Confidence (Compatibility) Intervals, P-Values, and S-Values to Form Consonance Functions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zad Rafi Chow & Andrew Vigotsky

Description: Allows one to compute confidence (compatibility) intervals for various statistical tests along with their corresponding P-values and S-values. The intervals can be plotted to create P- and S-value functions allowing one to see what effect sizes are compatible with the test model at various levels rather than being limited to one interval estimate.
